# Keynotes, Conference Talks, Workshops, and Other Presentations by Chris DeMars

I have too many repos that aren't actually useful on their own because they're disjointed presentations, demos, and other nonsense. The goal of this repo is to create a single location where presentations live, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

## Whatâ€™s In This Repo?

-   [Bio and details](#about-chris)
-   [Keynote slides, details, and videos (when available)](#keynotes)
-   [Workshop slides and details](#workshops)
-   [Technical session slides, details, and videos (when available)](#talks)
-   [Videos of previous talks](#videos-of-previous-presentations)
